At CDG they told us no..we had to do it when we checked in, on departure day (no problem)...on departure day they said no, we could do it at the gate, and at the gate they said no.  This was all blamed on the booking agent.  We got stuck in middle seats, which are a real problem for me, as I have a back problem.  My back went out, and I am now laid up for at least 2 weeks.

We payed a premium rate for the convenience of flying out of wilmington and when our flight was cancelled 2x we had no choice but to drive to raleigh because there were no alternatives out of wilmington due to limited flights offered out of wilmington and bad weather in one of the hubs (atlanta). Iam now unclear as to what company should be responsible for compensating us with the extra expenses incured from this.
